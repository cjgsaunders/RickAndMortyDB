An Android app that uses the Rick and Morty API<br />
<br />

Tech Used:<br />
<br />
Dagger/Hilt for DI<br />
MockK / Jupiter for testing<br />
Glide to Asyncronously load images from the web<br />
Compose for the views<br />
Retrofit to make API calls<br />
<br />

Designed with clean architecture keeping :<br />
<br />
api calls and their mappers in the data layer, <br />
objects created from those apis and the api interface in the domain layer <br />
and views and viewmodels in the presentation layer<br />
<br />
