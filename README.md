An Android app that uses the Rick and Morty API

Tech Used:
Dagger/Hilt for DI
MockK / Jupiter for testing
Glide to Asyncronously load images from the web
Compose for the views
Retrofit to make API calls

Designed with clean architecture keeping :
api calls and their mappers in the data layer, 
objects created from those apis and the api interface in the domain layer 
and views and viewmodels in the presentation layer
